*is responsible for keeping track of state to continue.*

```

RequiredFields: message (description of error), type
```
Some error types to use:
1 - required field missing -- in message name the field
2 - request not supported -- in message name the request that is not supported
3 - request got wrong type -- in message name what was expected
0 - any other errors, in this case the message will just be displayed

*NOTE: The client should display the error message that is sent by the server so the client can display it to the player.*
