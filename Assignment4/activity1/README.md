Project Description / Detailed Desciption :

This program allows clients to connect and manipulate a collection of intergers by adding, displaying, sorting and switching inputed integers from the client side. There are three options of running the task users can select task1 which is a basic implemenation of a server/client, the task2 is the introduction of threading with client/server by allowing multiple clients to interact with the server, and a thread pool task3 which like the task two allows multiple clients but specifies a max amount of connections. 

How to run each :

To run the client : gradle runClient
To run the first basic client/server : gradle runTask1
To run the second threading : gradle runTask2
To run the third thread pool : gradle runTask3

What the program excepts :

Clients should connect to server then should then specify what they would like to do entering a number 0-4.
The user can then enter an interger, sort, add, switch or quit if they would like to. For switch please do not do zero based indexing, start at 1.

Part e of the requirment : designed output messages for client to help guide user and make it easy to read and follow. 

Requirements completed : 

Completed all requriments as given:
[x] Task One : Implementing the specified performer.
[x] Task Two : Multithreading server
[x] Task Three : Bounder muti-threaded server
[x] Gradle task : implement given gradle requirments.
